# From GMS to HMS

If you landed here, I'm confident you:

- know what are the [Huawei Mobile Services (HMS)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms) , Huawei's alternative to [Google Play Services (GMS)](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview)
- are aware that - because of [US-China trade war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinaâ€“United_States_trade_war) - the new Huawei devices (P40 and Mate 30 series upwards) will not have GMS preinstalled anymore, therefore users cannot access Google Play to download your apps and instead they can do it via [Huawei's AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/).
- have the desire to onboard AppGallery with your apps already published on Google Play.

Great, then let's get started.
